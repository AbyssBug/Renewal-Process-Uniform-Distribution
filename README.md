# Renewal-Process-Uniform-Distribution
Write Python ( or any other language ) program to simulate this behavior .
1. Set Sum = 0
2. Set Count = 0
3. Generate random variable with U [0,1] = x
4. Sum = Sum + x
5. Count = Count + 1
6. If (Sum < 1), then Repeat Step 3
7. Keep Count value in list
8. Repeat 1 to 6 steps 10000 times
9. Find the average of Count

Repeat the task for rolling a die
